# website-page-convert
For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.
This project was done to help a company understand if they should implement a new web page the company has developed in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert", keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.   
The repository contains 3 files. The first file is a jupyter notebook devided into 3 main parts, in the first section is a descriptive statistics part, the second is an A/B test, and the third one is a logistic regression part. 
The second file "ab_test" contains the records of users and wheather they converted or not.
The third file "countries" contains the contries the users of the company were at. This file was used in the logistic regression part to see if countries is a significant factor in the results.
